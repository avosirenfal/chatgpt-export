# Save Chat Button for ChatGPT

This Tampermonkey script adds a "Save Chat" button under "Logout" in the bottom left on ChatGPT, allowing you to save the currently open chat history as a local HTML file. The file will be named using the SHA-1 hash of the first response given as part of the filename.

## How do I add the script to Tampermonkey?
1. Install the Tampermonkey browser extension from your browser's extension store if you haven't already.
2. See [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102) for what to do next.

## What about a manual install?
1. Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avosirenfal/chatgpt-export/master/script.js) for the latest copy of the script.
2. Copy the script into Tampermonkey's new script page, and hit 'save'.



The "Save Chat" button should now be added under "Logout" in the bottom left on ChatGPT.

Note: The script may need to be updated if the ChatGPT site changes.
